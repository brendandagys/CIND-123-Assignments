## Question 1 (50%)

Consider the probability distribution associated with rolling 3 fair dice.
We can label the faces of a single die using the numbers from 1 to 6.
We can therefore label the simple events in this distribution by triples of numbers from 1 to 6.
Let `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` represent the labels on each of the dice.

a) Set `d1` to the sequence (1,2,...,6) repeated 36 times.

```{r}
d1 = rep(1:6, times = 36)
```

b) Set `d2` to the sequence consisting of 6 repetitions of the sequence in which each of the numbers (1,2,...,6) is repeated 6 times.

```{r}
d2 = rep(1:6, each = 6, times = 6)
```

c) Set `d3` to the sequence in which each of the numbers (1,2,...,6) is repeated 36 times.

```{r}
d3 = rep(1:6, each = 36)
```
d) Create a new data frame `three.dice` from `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` and print it.
Visually confirm that there are $6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216$ rows and each row contains a unique combination of dice labels.

```{r}
three.dice = data.frame(d1, d2, d3)
print(three.dice)
```
e) Since the dice are fair and independent, each simple event has the same probability, namely $\frac{1}{216}$. Add the column `P` to the data frame with this value.
```{r}
three.dice$P = 1/216
```
f) Add a new column `sum` equal to the sum of the dice labels.
Add another new column `mean` equal to the average of the dice labels.

```{r}
three.dice$sum = d1 + d2 + d3
three.dice$mean = (d1 + d2 + d3)/3
```
g) Plot a probability histogram of `three.dice$sum`.

```{r}
phistogram = hist(three.dice$sum, freq = 0, breaks = 2.5:18.5, main = "Probability Histogram of the Sums", xlab = "Sum", ylab = "Probability")
phistogram$counts
```
h) Compute the probability that the sum of the dice is greater then 12 and less than 18.

**HINT**: Use `subset()` to select the events and sum `P`.

```{r}
sum(subset(three.dice, sum > 12 & sum < 18, select = P))
```
i) Compute the probability that the sum is even.

```{r}
sum(subset(three.dice, sum %% 2 == 0, select = P))
```
j) Compute the probability that the mean is exactly 4.

```{r}
sum(subset(three.dice, mean == 4, select = P))
```

## Question 2 (50%)
a)You have two groups of distinctly different items, 10 in the first group and 8 in the second. If you select one item from each group, how many different pairs can you form?
```{r}
n = 10
m = 8
n * m
```

b)Evaluate the following permutation $P_{3}^5$
```{r}
choose(5, 3) * factorial(3)
```

c)Evaluate the following combinations $C_{3}^5 + C_{2}^5$
```{r}
choose(5, 3) + choose(5, 2)
```
d)In how many ways can you select five people from a group of eight if the order of selection is important?
```{r}
choose(8, 5) * factorial(5)
```
e)In how many ways can you select two people from a group of 20 if the order of selection is not important?
```{r}
choose(20, 2)
```
